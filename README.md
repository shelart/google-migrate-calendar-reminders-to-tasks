# Migrate Google Calendar Reminders -> Google Tasks

This project allows you to migrate your existing old Reminders in
Google Calendar into the new Google Tasks.

Even though the official Android application
[Google Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks)
provides an option to migrate Reminders, it severely lacks flexibility. In fact,
it simply migrates **every** Reminder into a single (though selected by the end
user) Tasks list, not giving you much choice.

Unlike that officially provided migration way, this project grants you much
more control on what Reminders you'd like to migrate, and to what Tasks lists.
And it still provides you a flexible automation for batch processes!
